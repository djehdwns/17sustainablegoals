This is a comic series that consists of 17 episodes, a prologue and an epilogue.
The comic is a project made by me that is based on the <b>17 Sustainable Goals </b>.</p>

   These are the goals that would guide the people to a better future, a brighter one. It considers the global challenges that weâ€™ve faced,
  we face and will face.The world is coming close to its end due to the tremendous drainage of resources, destruction of systems and pollution
  that have been caused by humans for the past many centuries.Unless we contribute to sustainable development, the world, and our future generation
  would have to endure ordeals and face a terrible fate.It is our responsibility and should be our priority to contribute and work on to these goals
  in order to avoid the plights of our future generations. click on the images to go to the episodes.
